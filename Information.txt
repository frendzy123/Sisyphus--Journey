Project Description: A B-Game that depicts the story of Sysiphus. 
Background:
   Myth Of Sisyphus is a philosophical book written by Albert Camus. The main topic of this book is about absurd and revolt. A personâ€™s life is just like the hero Sisyphus from Greek mythology who was made to repeat a meaningless and absurd task of carrying a boulder up a mountain and then seeing it roll down again. This game is going to reproduce the task of Sisyphus and illustrate the philosophy behind it.  

Screenshot Descriptions:
	1) Player is jumping and trying to push the boulder. This allows for different angles to push the boulder.
	2) This is the start of the game. One mistake can land the boulder all the way back here.
	3) The Player is in the sky. The game allows for infinite jumps, however there is an invisible boundary to limit the height.
	4) This is the portion of the game where the player has almost taken the boulder to the top of the mountain. At the top waits a suprise.

Language/Platform:
